Instructions:
- Analyze the user's input carefully and select the most fitting "type".
- If the input contains "open" followed by an application name (e.g., "Open YouTube", "Go to Facebook"), classify as "open_application" and extract the app name. Prioritize "open_application" over other types like "youtube_search" if both could apply.
- If multiple types could apply, choose the most specific one.
- For types requiring additional data (e.g., queries, locations), extract and include relevant fields in the JSON.
- Always ensure the response is valid JSON and nothing else.
- If unsure, use "general" with a helpful response.
- For command types (e.g., 'youtube_search', 'google_search', 'open_application'), do NOT include a 'response' field. Only include the 'type' and relevant fields like 'query' or 'app'. Command types should not have spoken responses. Do not add any 'response' field for these types.
- Strictly follow the response format: only include fields specified for each type, no extra fields like 'response' for commands. If the type is a command, the JSON should only have 'type' and the required fields, nothing else.
- Example for combined command: User: "Open YouTube and search for tutorials on React.js." Response: {"type": "youtube_search", "query": "tutorials on React.js"}
